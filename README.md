These are my dotfiles.
# Setup
The setup script was mainly created for my wsl (Windows Subsystem for Linux) installations.
To get my setup on your ubuntu install just run
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hruzgar/dotfiles/main/setup_linux.sh)"
```
This will automatically install zsh, oh-my-zsh and all tools i use in the linux-cl so i don't need to manually setup everything all the time.
If you use Windows Terminal you should also select the "One Half Dark" theme if you want everything to look perfectly. Enjoy :)
