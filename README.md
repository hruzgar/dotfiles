# Ubuntu Setup
The setup script was mainly created for my wsl (Windows Subsystem for Linux) installations.
To get my setup on your ubuntu follow the instructions.
### Prerequisits
- Ubuntu >=22.04 or any Debian distro with apt package manager
- git
- curl
### Install
run
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hruzgar/dotfiles/main/setup_linux.sh)"
```
This will automatically install zsh, oh-my-zsh and all tools i use in the linux-cl so i don't need to manually setup everything all the time.
If you use Windows Terminal you should also select the "One Half Dark" theme if you want everything to look perfectly. Enjoy :)
